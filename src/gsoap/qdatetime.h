/*
	qdatetime.h

	Custom serializer for Qt's QDateTime type as xsd:dateTime.
	
	Requires Qt 4.8 or higher.
	
	When serializing: If the QDateTime is invalid, it will be 
	defaulted to 01-01-01T00:00:00.000Z.
	When deserializing: If a timezone is found, the QDateTime
	will automatically be converted to UTC.

	#import this file into your gSOAP .h file.

	To automate the wsdl2h-mapping of xsd:dateTime to
	QDateTime, add this line to the typemap.dat file:

	xsd__dateTime = #import "custom/qdatetime.h" | xsd__dateTime 

	When using soapcpp2 option -q<name> or -p<name>, you must change
	qdatetime.cpp as follows:

		#include "soapH.h"  ->  #include "nameH.h"

	Compile and link your code with custom/qdatetime.cpp
