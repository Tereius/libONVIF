@section wsse_5 Security Header

The material in this section relates to the WS-Security specification section 5.

To use the wsse plugin:
-# Run wsdl2h -t typemap.dat on a WSDL of a service that requires WS-Security
   headers. The typemap.dat file is used to recognize and translate Security
   header blocks for XML signature and encryption.
-# Run soapcpp2 on the header file produced by wsdl2h.
-# (Re-)compile stdsoap2.c/pp, dom.c/pp, smdevp.c, mecevp.c, wsseapi.c and the
   generated source files with the `-DWITH_DOM` and `-DWITH_OPENSSL` compiler
   flags set. The smdevp.c, mecevp.c, and wsseapi.c files are located in the
   'plugin' directory.
-# Use the wsse plugin API functions described below to add and verify
   Security headers, sign and verify messages, and to encrypt/decrypt messages.

An example WS-Security client/server application can be found in gsoap/samples/wsse.

Another example WS-Security client/server application that is designed to
interoperate with WCF can be found in gsoap/samples/WCF/Basic/MessageSecurity.

@warning
The security token handler callback function parameters have changed in 2.8.34
and greater with the addition of KeyIdentifier information `keyid` and
`keyidlen`.  To register your own security token handler function with the
plugin, make sure that your functions matches these function parameters:
@code
    const void *security_token_handler(struct soap *soap, int *alg, const char *keyname, const unsigned char *keyid, int keyidlen, int *keylen);
@endcode

The wsse engine is thread safe. However, if HTTPS is required then please
follow the instructions in Section @ref wsse_11 to ensure thread-safety of
WS-Security with HTTPS.

The wsse API code is implemented in:

- `gsoap/plugin/wsseapi.h` wsse API declarations.
- `gsoap/plugin/wsseapi.c` wsse API for C and C++.

You will also need:

- `gsoap/plugin/smdevp.c` compile and link this file (C and C++).
- `gsoap/plugin/mecevp.c` compile and link this file (C and C++).
- compile all sources with `-DWITH_OPENSSL -DWITH_DOM`.
- if you have zlib installed, compile all sources also with `-DWITH_GZIP`.
- link with `-lssl -lcrypto -lz -lgsoapssl++` (or `-lgsoapssl` for C, or compile `stdsoap2.cpp` for C++ and `stdsoap2.c` for C).

The gSOAP header file (generated with wsdl2h, and containing the data binding
interface for soapcpp2) should import wsse.h (or the older 2002 version
wsse2.h):

@code
    #import "wsse.h"
@endcode

The wsdl2h tool adds the necessary imports to the generated header file if the
WSDL declares the use of WS-Security. If not, you may have to add the import
manually before running soapcpp2.

The wsse API consists of a set of functions to populate and verify WS-Security
headers and message body content. For more details, we refer to the following
sections that correspond to the WS-Security specification sections:

- Section 6 @ref wsse_6
- Section 7 @ref wsse_7
- Section 8 @ref wsse_8
- Section 9 @ref wsse_9
- Section 10 @ref wsse_10
- @ref wsse_11
- @ref wsse_12
- @ref wsse_13
- @ref wsse_wsc

The basic API is introduced below.

To add an empty Security header block to the SOAP header, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_Security(soap);
@endcode

To delete a Security header, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap);
@endcode

Adding an empty Security header block is not very useful. In the following, we
present the higher-level functions of the wsse plugin to populate and verify
Security header content.

@note
The soap context includes an actor value soap.actor that is populated and
rendered as the SOAP-ENV:actor (SOAP 1.1) or SOAP-ENV:role (SOAP 1.2) attribute
in XML within the generic SOAP Header. The attribute is optional, but should be
used to target a recipient such as an intermediate node to process the SOAP
header.  In contrast, actor or role attributes within Security header blocks
target specific recipients to process the Security header block. The gSOAP
implementation does not automate this feature and application should set and
check the actor/role attribute when necessary. In addition, the current
implementation supports the inclusion of a single Security header block in the
SOAP header.

To populate the SOAP-ENV:actor or SOAP-ENV:role attribute within the Security
header, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_Security_actor(soap, "recipient");
@endcode

To obtain the actor or role value (e.g. after receiving a message), use:

@code
    _wsse__Security *security = soap_wsse_Security(soap);
    if (security)
    {
      ... = security->SOAP_ENV__actor; // SOAP 1.1
      ... = security->SOAP_ENV__role;  // SOAP 1.2
@endcode

The SOAP-ENV:mustUnderstand attribute is automatically added and checked by the
gSOAP engine. A gSOAP application compiled without Security support will reject
Security headers.

Security header blocks are attached to the soap context, which means that the
information will be automatically kept to support multiple invocations.

@section wsse_6 Security Tokens

The material in this section relates to the WS-Security specification section 6.

@subsection wsse_6_2 User Name Tokens

To add a user name token to the Security header block, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenText(soap, "Id", "username", NULL);
@endcode

The `Id` value is optional. When non-NULL the user name token is included in the
digital signature to protect its integrity. It is common for the wsse plugin
functions to accept such `Id`s, which are serialized as wsu:Id identifiers for
cross-referencing XML elements. The signature engine of the wsse plugin is
designed to automatically sign all wsu:Id attributed elements to simplify the
code you need to write to implement the signing process.

To add a user name token with clear text password, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenText(soap, "Id", "username", "password");
@endcode

It is strongly recommended to use `soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenText` only in
combination with HTTPS encrypted transmission or not at all. A better
alternative is to use password digests. With password digest authentication,
the digest value of a password (with message creation time and a random nonce)
is compared on both sides, thus eliminating the need to exchange a password
over the wire.

To add a user name token with password digest, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenDigest(soap, "Id", "username", "password");
@endcode

Although the password string is passed to this function, it is not rendered in
XML or stored in a message log. Only digests are compared on both sides, not
the passwords. This authentication method adds a timestamp and nonce to prevent
message replay attacks.

It has been argued that this approach adopted by the WS-Security protocol is
still vulnerable since the application retrieves the password in text form
requiring a database to store passwords in clear text. However, a digest
algorithm can be used to hash the passwords and store their digests instead,
which eliminates the need to store clear-text passwords. This is a common
approach adopted by Unix for decades.

By setting the `Id` value to a unique string, the user name token is also
digitally signed by the signature engine further preventing tampering with its
value.

You must use `soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenDigest` for each message exchange
to refresh the password digest even when the user name and password are not
changed. Otherwise, the receiver might flag the message as a replay attack.

To specify a time stamp for the digest instead of the current time, use:

@code
    time_t when = ...;
    soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenDigest_at(soap, "Id", "username", "password", when);
@endcode

Clear-text passwords and password digests are verified with
`soap_wsse_verify_Password`. To verify a password at the receiving side to
authorize a request (e.g. within a Web service operation), use:

@code
    int ns__myMethod(struct soap *soap, ...)
    {
      const char *username = soap_wsse_get_Username(soap);
      const char *password;
      if (!username)
      {
        soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap); // remove old security headers
        return soap->error; // no username: return FailedAuthentication (from soap_wsse_get_Username)
      }
      password = ...; // lookup password of username
      if (soap_wsse_verify_Password(soap, password))
      {
        int err = soap->error;
        soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap); // remove old security headers
        // if it is required to return signed faults, then add the following six lines here:
        if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
         || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token")
         || soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0)
        {
          soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap); // remove security headers (failed construction)
          return soap->error;
        }
        return err; // password verification failed: return FailedAuthentication
      }
      ... // process request, then sign the response message:
      if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
       || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token")
       || soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0)
      {
        soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap); // remove security headers (failed construction)
        return soap->error;
      }
      return SOAP_OK;
    }
@endcode

Note that the `soap_wsse_get_Username` functions sets the
wsse:FailedAuthentication fault upon failure. It is common for the wsse plugin
functions to return `SOAP_OK` or a wsse fault that should be passed to the sender
by returning soap->error from service operations. The fault is displayed with
the `soap_print_fault` function. To return signed faults back to the client, a
signature is constructed as shown in the code snippet above. When the signature
construction itself fails, we delete the partially constructed signature and
return the fault to the client.

Password digest authentication prevents message replay attacks. The wsse plugin
keeps a database of password digests to thwart replay attacks. This is the only
part in the plugin code that requires mutex provided by threads.h. Of course,
this only works correctly if the server is persistent, such as a stand-alone
service. Note that CGI-based services do not keep state. Machine clocks must be
synchronized and clock skew should not exceed `SOAP_WSSE_CLKSKEW` at the
server side.

@subsection wsse_6_3 Binary Security Tokens

X509 certificates are commonly included in Security header blocks as binary
security tokens. A certificate is used to verify the digital signature of a
digitally signed message using the public key embedded within the certificate.
The certificate itself is signed by a certificate authority (CA) that vouches
for the authenticity of the certificate, i.e. to prove the identify of the
message originator. This verification process is important, because digital
signatures are useless without verification: an attacker could simply replace
the message, sign it, and replace the certificate.

Certificates are automatically verified by the wsse plugin signature engine
when received and accessed, which means that the certificates of the CAs must
be made accessible to the wsse plugin as follows:

@code
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // use this
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)
@endcode

The `soap_wsse_verify_X509` function checks the validity of a certificate.
The check is automatically performed. The check is also performed when
retrieving the certificate from a Security header block, either automatically
by the wsse plugin's signature verification engine or manually as follows:

@code
    X509 *cert = soap_wsse_get_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "Id");
@endcode

where `Id` is the identification string of the binary security token or NULL to
get the first found in the Security header.

The X509 certificate returned by this function should be freed with `X509_free`
to deallocate the certificate data:

@code
    if (cert)
      X509_free(cert);
    cert = NULL;
@endcode

The verification is an expensive process that will be optimized in future
releases by caching the certificate chain.

To attach a binary security token stored in a PEM file to a Security header
block for transmission, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenPEM(soap, NULL, "mycert.pem")
@endcode

A binary security token can be automatically signed by setting its `Id`
attribute:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenPEM(soap, "X509Token", "mycert.pem")
@endcode

Repeatedly loading a certificate from a PEM file is inefficient. To reuse a
certificate loaded from a PEM file for multiple invocations, use:

@code
    FILE *fd = fopen("mycert.pem", "r");
    X509 *cert = PEM_read_X509(fd, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    fclose(fd);
    if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert))
      ... // an error occurred
@endcode

Other types of binary security tokens can be added to the Security header block using:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityToken(soap, "Id", "valueType", data, datalen);
@endcode

@section wsse_6_4 SAML and Other Tokens

The use and processing rules for tokens such as SAML assertions is specific to
an application.  SAML 1.0 and 2.0 tokens are supported with the following
functions to retrieve them from Security header blocks:

@code
    saml1__AssertionType *assertion1 = soap_wsse_get_saml1(soap);
@endcode

@code
    saml2__AssertionType *assertion2 = soap_wsse_get_saml2(soap);
@endcode

The pointers returned are non-NULL when these tokens are present.  You can
verify that a token is signed by the signature of the Security header with:

@code
    saml2__AssertionType *assertion2 = soap_wsse_get_saml2(soap);
    if (!assertion2 || soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, SOAP_NAMESPACE_OF_saml2, "Assertion") == 0)
      ... error // no Assertion or Assertion not signed by WS-Security signature (zero Assertion elements signed)
@endcode

If the SAML token received contains a signature and/or time range conditions
then you should verify that the SAML token is valid after receiving it in a
Security header block of a WS-Security message:

@code
    if (saml2->saml2__Conditions)
    {
      time_t now = time(NULL);
      if (saml2->saml2__Conditions->NotBefore && *saml2->saml2__Conditions->NotBefore > now)
        ... error // not valid yet
      if (saml2->saml2__Conditions->NotOnOrAfter && *saml2->saml2__Conditions->NotOnOrAfter <= now)
        ... error // expired
    }
    if (saml2->ds__Signature)
      if (soap_wsse_verify_with_signature(soap, saml2->ds__Signature))
        ... error // Assertion has signature but token is invalid
@endcode

The above assumes that a WS-Security message was received that was signed and
decrypted (when applicable).

@note The resolution of the dateTime values of `NotBefore` and `NotOnOrAfter`
is determined by the clock resolution of `time_t`, which is usually seconds.
To increase the resolution, edit `gsoap/import/saml2.h` and add
`#import "custom/struct_timeval.h"`.  Then replace `time_t` in
`gsoap/import/saml2.h` with `xsd__dateTime` to use `struct timeval`, which
includes the time in seconds `tv_sec` and a microsecond offset `tv_usec`.

To add a SAML token to the WS-Security headers, use
`soap_wsse_add_saml1(struct soap*, const char *id)` or
`soap_wsse_add_saml2(struct soap*, const char *id)`:

@code
    time_t now = time(NULL);
    saml1__AssertionType *assertion1 = soap_wsse_add_saml1(soap, "SAML1");
    if (!assertion1)
      ... // error
    assertion1->IssueInstant = now;
    assertion1->Issuer = (char*)"MyCompany";
    assertion1->saml1__Conditions = soap_new_saml1__ConditionsType(soap, -1);
    if (!assertion1->saml1__Conditions)
      ... // error
    // valid from now for up to one hour
    assertion1->saml1__Conditions->NotBefore = soap_new_dateTime(soap, -1)
    if (!assertion1->saml1__Conditions->NotBefore)
      ... // error
    *assertion1->saml1__Conditions->NotBefore = now;
    assertion1->saml1__Conditions->NotOnOrAfter = soap_new_dateTime(soap, -1)
    if (!assertion1->saml1__Conditions->NotOnOrAfter)
      ... // error
    *assertion1->saml1__Conditions->NotOnOrAfter = now + 3600;
    ...
@endcode

and, respectively:

@code
    time_t now = time(NULL);
    saml2__AssertionType *assertion2 = soap_wsse_add_saml2(soap, "SAML2");
    if (!assertion2)
      ... // error
    assertion2->IssueInstant = now;
    assertion2->saml2__Issuer = (struct saml2__NameIDType*)soap_malloc(soap, sizeof(struct saml2__NameIDType));
    soap_default_saml2__NameIDType(soap, assertion2->saml2__Issuer);
    assertion2->saml2__Issuer->__item = (char*)"MyCompany";
    // valid from now for up to one hour
    assertion2->saml2__Conditions->NotBefore = soap_new_dateTime(soap, -1)
    if (!assertion2->saml2__Conditions->NotBefore)
      ... // error
    *assertion2->saml2__Conditions->NotBefore = now;
    assertion2->saml2__Conditions->NotOnOrAfter = soap_new_dateTime(soap, -1)
    if (!assertion2->saml2__Conditions->NotOnOrAfter)
      ... // error
    *assertion2->saml2__Conditions->NotOnOrAfter = now + 3600;
    ...
@endcode

The code shown above adds an empty SAML token to the Security header block
after which the SAML assertion issuer, subject, conditions, statements, and
attributes should be set.  Once these are set, the assertion can be signed
with a ds:Signature and X509 certificate added to the assertion to create an
enveloped signature:

@code
    EVP_PKEY *rsa_private_key; // private key
    X509 *cert;                // certificate (e.g. in "cacert.pem")
    ...
    saml2__AssertionType *assertion2 = soap_wsse_add_saml2(soap, "SAML2");
    if (!assertion2)
      ... // error
    ... // set SAML issuer, subject, conditions, statements, and attributes
    if (soap_wsse_sign_saml2(soap, assertion2, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, private_key, 0, cert))
      ... error // could not sign and/or add cert to X509Data
    soap->cafile = "cacert.pem"; // file that contains the public certificate
    if (soap_wsse_verify_saml2(soap, assertion2))
      ... error // coult not verify the signature, e.g. invalid key-certificate pair
@endcode

It is a good habit to verify a SAML token that was created in memory with
`int soap_wsse_verify_saml1(struct soap*, saml1__AssertionType *saml1)` or
`int soap_wsse_verify_saml2(struct soap*, saml2__AssertionType *saml2)` as
shown.  This step is optional, but can be useful to detect if the private key
and certificate are uncorrelated and should not be used.

The private key and certificate values can be obtained as shown in Section
@ref wsse_8_2a.

For implementing other types of tokens, you are encouraged to modify the
import/wsse.h file to add more tokens to the `_wsse__Security` header block:

@code
    struct somens__SomeTokenType { @char *wsu__Id; ... };

    typedef struct _wsse__Security
    {       ...
            struct saml1__AssertionType*            saml1__Assertion;
            struct saml2__AssertionType*            saml2__Assertion;
            struct somens__SomeTokenType*           somens__SomeToken; // added an optional token
            ...                                                        // add more if needed
            @char*                                  SOAP_ENV__actor;
            @char*                                  SOAP_ENV__role;
    } _wsse__Security;
@endcode

The tokens can be set with:

@code
    _wsse__Security *security = soap_wsse_Security(soap);
    security->somens__SomeToken = (struct somens__SomeTokenType*)soap_malloc(soap, sizeof(struct somens__SomeTokenType));
    soap_default_somens__SomeTokenType(soap, security->somens__SomeToken);
    security->somens__SomeToken->wsu__Id = "myToken"; // allows for auto-signing this element
    ...
@endcode
 
For tokens in DOM XML form, use the `xsd__anyType` DOM element:

@code
    typedef struct _wsse__Security
    {       ...
            xsd__anyType*                           somens__SomeToken; // added an optional token in DOM form
    } _wsse__Security;
@endcode

The token in DOM form can be signed if you set the wsu:Id attribute to a unique
value say "MyToken":

@code
    _wsse__Security *security = soap_wsse_Security(soap);
    security->somens__SomeToken = (xsd__anyType*)soap_malloc(soap, sizeof(xsd__anyType));
    soap_default_xsd__anyType(soap, security->somens__SomeToken);
    soap_att_text(soap_att(soap_add_security->somens__SomeToken, NULL, "wsu:Id"), "MyToken");
    ...
@endcode

We recommend to use [domcpp](http://www.genivia.com/doc/dom/html/index.html) to
generate code to set the token to send messages and get its values after
receiving messages.

For tokens in XML "string" text form, use the `_XML` literal string (a `char*`
type with XML content):

@code
    typedef struct _wsse__Security
    {       ...
            _XML                                    somens__SomeToken; // added an optional token in string form
    } _wsse__Security;
@endcode

However, beware that XML text cannot be signed by the signature as a Security
header (unless you embed it within a new element in the Security header block
and set that element's wsu:Id attribute).

@section wsse_7 Token References

The material in this section relates to the WS-Security specification section 7.

To use a certificate for signature verification, add a direct security token
reference URI for the token to the KeyInfo, for example:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceURI(soap, "URI", "valueType");
@endcode

and:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "URI");
@endcode

For X509 certificates we use this to add a binary security token with the
certificate and a reference to the local token:

@code
    if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
     || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token"))
      ... // an error occurred
@endcode

This follows the recommended practice to place Security token references in
the KeyInfo element of a Signature. The KeyInfo is used to verify the validity
of a signature value.

Key identifiers can be used as well:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceKeyIdentifier(soap, "Id", "valueType", data, datalen);
@endcode

Embedded references are added with:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceEmbedded(soap, "Id", "valueType");
@endcode

Full support for embedded references requires coding to add tokens and
assertions, as well as to consume embedded references at the receiving side.
There is no automated mechanism to take the embedded references and process
them accordingly.

The use of key names is not recommended, but in case they are required they can
be added with:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_KeyName(soap, "name");
@endcode

@section wsse_8 Signatures

The material in this section relates to the WS-Security specification section 8.

The wsse plugin must be registered to sign and verify messages:

@code
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
@endcode

XML signatures are usually computed over normalized XML (to ensure the XML
processors of intermediate nodes can accurately reproduce the XML). To this
end, the exclusive canonical XML standard (exc-c14n) is required, which is set
using the `SOAP_XML_CANONICAL` flag:

@code
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
@endcode

To send messages with inclusive canonicalization, in addition to the
`SOAP_XML_CANONICAL` flag also use: 

@code
    soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "*");
@endcode

However, exclusive canonicalization is recommended over inclusive
canonicalization, or no canonicalization at all.  WS Basic Security profile 1.0
requires exclusive canonicalization.

Flags to consider:

- `SOAP_XML_CANONICAL` recommended to enable exc-c14n (exclusive canonicalization).
- `SOAP_XML_INDENT` optional, to emit more readable XML (see warning below).
- `SOAP_IO_CHUNK` efficient HTTP-chunked streaming messages.
- `SOAP_ENC_GZIP` for HTTP compression (also enables HTTP chunking).

@warning
Interoperability with WCF WS-Security is not guaranteed when `SOAP_XML_INDENT`
is enabled.  Avoid using `SOAP_XML_INDENT` for interoperability.  The
implementation of canonicalization in WCF with respect to the normalization of
white space between XML tags differs from the protocol standards.

Next, decide which signature algorithm is appropriate to use:

- HMAC-SHA uses a secret key (also known as a shared key in symmetric
  cryptography) to sign the SHA digest of the SignedInfo element.
- DSA-SHA uses a DSA private key to sign the SHA digest of the SignedInfo
  element.
- RSA-SHA uses a RSA private key to sign the SHA digest of the SignedInfo
  element.
- ECDSA-SHA uses a Elliptic Curve DSA private key to sign the SHA digest of the
  SignedInfo element.

HMAC-SHA is the simplest method, but relies on the fact that you have to make
absolutely sure the key is kept secret on both the sending and receiving side.
As long as the secret key is confidential, messages are securely signed.
However, this is virtually impossible when exchanging messages with untrusted
disparate parties. The advantage of HMAC-SHA is the speed by which messages
are signed and verified.

Algorithms HMAC SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512 are supported:

- `SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA1`   http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#hmac-sha1
- `SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA224` http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha224
- `SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA256` http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha256
- `SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA384` http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha384
- `SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA512` http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#hmac-sha512

DSA-SHA and RSA-SHA rely on public key cryptography. In simplified terms, a
message is signed using the (confidential!) private key. The public key is used
to verify the signature. Since only the originating party could have used its
private key to sign the message, the integrity of the message is guaranteed. Of
course, we must trust the public key came from the originator (it is often
included as an X509 certificate in the message). To this end, a trusted
certificate authority should have signed the public key, thereby creating a
X509 certificate that contains the public key and the identity of the message
originator.

The following DSA, RSA, and ECDSA algorithms are supported:

- `SOAP_SMD_SIGN_DSA_SHA1`     http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#dsa-sha1
- `SOAP_SMD_SIGN_DSA_SHA256`   http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig-more#dsa-sha256

An optional callback function can be passed to the plugin that is responsible
for providing a certificate or key to the wsse engine to verify a signed
message. For example, when a security token is absent from an DSA-SHA or
RSA-SHA signed message then the only mechanism to automatically verify the
signature is to let the callback produce a certificate:

@code
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    soap_wsse_set_security_token_handler(soap, security_token_handler);

    const void *security_token_handler(struct soap *soap, int *alg, const char *keyname, const unsigned char *keyid, int keyidlen, int *keylen)
    {
      // Get the user name from UsernameToken in message
      const char *uid = soap_wsse_get_Username(soap);

The security token handler callback function parameters have changed in 2.8.34

@subsection wsse_8_2a Signing Messages

After the plugin is registered and a signature algorithm selected, the
`soap_wsse_sign` function or the `soap_wsse_sign_body` function is used
to initiate the signature engine to automatically sign outbound messages.

The code to sign the SOAP Body of a message using HMAC-SHA1 is:

@code
    static char hmac_key[16] =
    { 0xff, 0xee, 0xdd, 0xcc, 0xbb, 0xaa, 0x99, 0x88,
      0x77, 0x66, 0x55, 0x44, 0x33, 0x22, 0x11, 0x00 };
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    if (soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA1, hmac_key, sizeof(hmac_key))
      ... // an error occurred
    else if (soap_call_ns__myMethod(soap, ...))
      ... // a transmission error occurred
@endcode

The `hmac_key` above is some secret key you generated for the sending side and
receiving side (don't use the one shown here). Instead of SHA1 above, you can
also use the more secure SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 hashes.

As always, use `soap_print_fault` to display the error message.

To sign the body of an outbound SOAP message using RSA-SHA (DSA-SHA is
similar), we include the X509 certificate with the public key as a
BinarySecurityToken in the header and a KeyInfo reference to the token to let
receivers use the public key in the certificate to verify the authenticity of
the message:

@code
    FILE *fd;
    EVP_PKEY *rsa_private_key;
    X509 *cert;
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    fd = fopen("privkey.pem", "r");
    rsa_private_key = PEM_read_PrivateKey(fd, NULL, NULL, "password");
    fclose(fd);
    fd = fopen("cert.pem", "r");
    X509 *cert = PEM_read_X509(fd, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    fclose(fd);
    if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
     || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token")
     || soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0))
      ... // an error occurred
    else if (soap_call_ns__myMethod(soap, ...))
      ... // a transmission error occurred
@endcode

The private key and its certificate are often placed in the same file, see e.g.
server.pem in the package.

To summarize the signing process:
-# Register the wsse plugin.
-# Obtain an HMAC secret key or a DSA/RSA/ECDSA private key.
-# For DSA or RSA, obtain the X509 certificate with the public key signed by a
   certificate authority.
-# Add the X509 certificate as a BinarySecurityToken to the header.
-# Add a KeyInfo BinarySecurityTokenReference.
-# Invoke `soap_wsse_sign_body` and/or `soap_wsse_sign` with
   `soap_wsse_sign_only` to sign the message.
-# Always check the function return values for errors. You don't want to
   produce and accept messages with an invalid Security headers.

@subsection wsse_8_2b Signing Message Parts

The `soap_wsse_sign_body` function signs the entire SOAP body but nothing else.
If it is desirable to sign individual parts of a message the
`soap_wsse_sign_only` and `soap_wsse_sign` functions should be used. All
message parts with wsu:Id attributes are signed.  These message parts should
not be nested (nested elements will not be separately signed). By default, all
and only those XML elements with wsu:Id attributes are signed. Therefore, the
wsu:Id attribute values used in a message must be unique within the message.
Although usually not required, the default signing rule can be overridden with
the `soap_wsse_sign_only` function, see @ref wsse_8_3.

For example, consider a transaction in which we only want to sign a contract in
the SOAP Body. This allows us to modify the rest of the message or extract the
contract in XML and pass it on with the signature.

The gSOAP header file includes a myContract declaration:

@code
    struct ns__myContract
    {
      @char* wsu__Id = "Contract";
      char* name;
      char* title;
      char* terms;
    };
    int ns__myMethod(struct ns__myContract agreement, bool* accepted);
@endcode

The default value of the wsu:Id is "Contract" so that we can instantiate the
struct, automatically sign it, and send it as follows:

@code
    struct ns__myContract contract;
    bool accept;
    soap_default_ns__myContract(soap, &contract);
    contract.name = ...;
    contract.title = ...;
    contract.terms = ...;
    if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
     || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token")
     || soap_wsse_sign(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0))
      ... // an error occurred
    else if (soap_call_ns__myMethod(soap, contract, &accept))
      ... // a transmission error occurred
@endcode

The above example shows a wsu:Id attribute embedded (hardcoded) in a struct.
When it is not possible to add the `wsu__Id` member, for example when the type is
a string instead of a struct, it is suggested to specify the XML element to be
signed with the `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "space-separated string of
element names")`. Use it before each call or in the server operation
(when returning XML data from a service operation). This lets the engine add
wsu:Id="tag" attribute-value pair to the element's tag name. For example:

@code
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "ns:myContract"); // <ns:myContract wsu:Id="ns:myContract">...
    soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "ns xsd"); // QNames have 'ns' and 'xsd' values
    if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
     || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token")
     || soap_wsse_sign(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0))
      ... // an error occurred
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, NULL); // reset
    soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, NULL); // reset
@endcode

This code adds the wsu:Id="ns-myContract" to the ns:myContract element. Here,
the `wsu__Id` value in the struct MUST NOT be set. Otherwise, two wsu:Id
attributes are present which is invalid. Also, the element signed must be
unique in the message. That is, there cannot be more than one matching element,
otherwise the resulting signature is invalid.

@note
To reset the automatic wsu:Id attributes addition, pass NULL to
`soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` as shown above. This is automatically performed when a new
message is received (but not automatically in a sequence of one-way sends for
example).

@note
It is generally known that QName content of elements and attribute values may
lead to verification issues with exclusive canonicalization
(`SOAP_XML_CANONICAL`), because XML processors may not recognize prefixes in
such QName contexts as visually utilized. With QName content in elements and
attributes and `SOAP_XML_CANONICAL` enabled, we should use
`soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "prefixlist")` to define which
namespace prefixes (space-separated in the string) should be considered
inclusive. For example, xsi:type attribute values are QNames with xsd types
(and perhaps other types), meaning we should add "xsd" to the inclusive
namespace prefix list with `soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "xsd")`
to ensure xsi:type="xsd:TYPE" attributes with QName content are properly signed
and not susceptible to certain wrapping attacks.  A quick way to include all
prefixes in the signed contents and thereby thwart signature wrapping attacks
is to use `soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "+")`.

@note
When signing parts of the body as outlined above, use `soap_wsse_sign`
(do NOT use `soap_wsse_sign_body`).

@warning
Do not attempt to sign an element with a wsu:Id that is a subelement of another
element with a wsu:Id, that is, do not sign inner nested wsu:Id elements. The
element that you will try to sign will not be canonicalized and will lead to a
failure of the signature verification. When elements with wsu:Id are nested,
sign the outermost element.

We recommend to sign the entire SOAP Body using `soap_wsse_sign_body` and
reserve the use of `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` for SOAP Header elements, such as
WS-Addressing elements. For example, to add and sign WS-Addressing 2005 headers
(which are activated with an `#import "wsa5.h"` in the header file for
soapcpp2):

@code
    #include "wsaapi.h"
    #include "wsseapi.h"
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsa);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    ...
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "wsa5:From wsa5:To wsa5:ReplyTo wsa5:FaultTo wsa5:Action wsa5:MessageID");
    if (soap_wsa_request(soap, RequestMessageID, ToAddress, RequestAction)
     || soap_wsa_add_From(soap, FromAddress) // optional: add a 'From' address
     || soap_wsa_add_FaultTo(soap, FaultToAddress))
      ... // error: out of memory
    if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
     || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token")
     || soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0))
      ... // an error occurred
    else if (soap_call_ns__myMethod(soap, ...))
      ... // a transmission error occurred
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, NULL);
@endcode

This code signs the wsa5 header elements that are set with `soap_wsa_request`,
see the WS-Addressing "wsa" API in the gSOAP documentation for more information
on the use of WS-Addressing). It is fine to specify more elements with
`soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` than actually present in the XML payload. The other
WS-Addressing headers are not present and are not signed.

If your are using WS-Addressing 2004 (which is activated with an
`#import "wsa.h"` in the header file for soapcpp2) then change one line:

@code
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "wsa:From wsa:To wsa:ReplyTo wsa:FaultTo wsa:Action wsa:MessageID");
@endcode

@note
`soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` should only be set once for each `soap_wsse_sign`
or `soap_wsse_sign_body`. Each new call overrides the previous setting.

@warning
Never use `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` to set the wsu:Id for an element that
occurs more than once in the payload, since each will have the same wsu:Id
attribute that may lead to a WS-Signature failure.

@subsection wsse_8_3 Signing Security Headers and Tokens

To sign security tokens such as user names, passwords, and binary security
tokens, just assign their Id values with a unique string, such as "Time" for
timestamps and "User" for user names. For example:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_Timestamp(soap, "Time", 600);
    soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenDigest(soap, "User", "username", "password");
    ... // the rest of the signing code
@endcode

Note that by default all wsu:Id-attributed elements are signed. To filter a
subset of wsu:Id-attributed elements for signatures, use the
`soap_wsse_sign_only` function to specify a subset of the elements that have
wsu:Id values as follows:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_Timestamp(soap, "Time", 600);
    soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenDigest(soap, "User", "username", "password");
    soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert);
    soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token");
    soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0);
    soap_wsse_sign_only(soap, "Time User Body"); // OK to use after soap_wsse_sign_body
@endcode

The wsu:Id values are provides with the `add` functions, such as "User" and
"X509Token". The SOAP Body always has a wsu:Id value "Body" when
`soap_wsse_sign_body` is used.

Note that in the above we MUST set the X509Token name for cross-referencing
with a wsu:Id, which normally results in automatically signing that token
unless filtered out with `soap_wsse_sign_only`. The SOAP Body wsu:Id is
always "Body" and should be part of the `soap_wsse_sign_only` set of wsu:Id
names to sign.

When using `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` we need to use the tag name with
`soap_wsse_sign_only`. For example:

@code
    soap_wsa_request(soap, RequestMessageID, ToAddress, RequestAction);
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "wsa5:To wsa5:From wsa5:ReplyTo wsa5:Action");
    soap_wsse_add_UsernameTokenDigest(soap, "User", "username", "password");
    soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert);
    soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token");
    soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0);
    soap_wsse_sign_only(soap, "wsa5:To wsa5:From wsa5:ReplyTo wsa5:Action User Body");
@endcode

@note
`soap_wsse_sign_only` should only be set once for each `soap_wsse_sign`
or `soap_wsse_sign_body`. Each new call overrides the previous.

@note
To reset the filtering of signed tokens and elements, pass NULL to
`soap_wsse_sign_only`. This is automatically performed when a new message is
received (but not automatically in a sequence of one-way sends for example).

@subsection wsse_8_4 Signature Validation

To automatically verify the signature of an inbound message signed with DSA or
RSA algorithms, assuming the message contains the X509 certificate as a binary
security token, use:

@code
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    soap_wsse_verify_auto(soap, SOAP_SMD_NONE, NULL, 0);
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // file with CA certs of peers
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs directory
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)

    // server:
    if (soap_serve(soap))
      ... // an error occurred

    // client:
    if (soap_call_ns__myMethod(soap, ...))
      ... // an error occurred
@endcode

All locally referenced and signed elements in the signed message will be
verified with `soap_wsse_verify_auto` using the default settings set with
`SOAP_SMD_NONE`. Elements that are not signed cannot be verified. Also elements
referenced with absolute URIs that are not part of the message are not
automatically verified. The received message is stored in a DOM accessible with
soap->dom. This enables further analysis of the message content.

For a post-parsing check to verify if an XML element was signed in an inbound
message, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_verify_auto(soap, SOAP_SMD_NONE, NULL, 0);
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // file with CA certs of peers
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs directory
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)
    ... // client call
    if (soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, "namespaceURI", "tag") == 1)
      ... // only one element with matching tag and namespace is signed
@endcode

The `soap_wsse_verify_element` function returns the number of matching elements
signed.

The signed element nesting rules are obeyed, so if the matching element is a
descendent of a signed element, it is signed as well.

Because it is a post check, a client should invoke `soap_wsse_verify_element`
after the call completed. A service should invoke this function within the
service operation routine, i.e. when the message request is accepted and about
to be processed.

For example, to check whether the wsu:Timestamp element was signed, e.g. after
checking that it is present and message expiration checked with
`soap_wsse_verify_Timestamp`, use:

@code
    if (!soap_wsse_verify_Timestamp(soap))
    {
      soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap);
      ... // error
    }
    else if (soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, "http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd", "Timestamp") > 0)
      ... // timestamp was signed
@endcode

To check the SOAP Body (either using SOAP 1.1 or 1.2), simply use
`soap_wsse_verify_body`.

The `soap_wsse_verify_auto` function keeps processing signed (and unsigned)
messages as they arrive. For unsigned messages this can be expensive and the
verification engine should be shut down using `soap_wsse_verify_done`.

There can be two problems with signature verification. First, some
WS-Security implementations include SignedInfo/Reference/@URI without targeting
an element, which will produce an error that a Reference URI target does not
exist. To ignore these references, use `SOAP_WSSE_IGNORE_EXTRA_REFS`. Second,
certificates provided by the peer are not verifiable unless the signing CA
certificate is included in the cafile or capath. To disable peer certificate
verification, set the fsslverify callback to return 1 as follows:

@code
    static int ssl_verify(int ok, X509_STORE_CTX *store)
    {
      // put certificate verification here, return 0 when fails 1 when ok
      return 1;
    }
    ...
    soap_wsse_verify_auto(soap, SOAP_SMD_NONE | SOAP_WSSE_IGNORE_EXTRA_REFS, NULL, 0);
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // file with CA certs of peers
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs directory
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)
    soap->fsslverify = ssl_verify; // set certificate verification callback
@endcode

To reject peer certificates under all conditions except specific permitted
conditions such as self-signed certificates in the chain, use the following
code as a guide (see OpenSSL documentation on `X509_STORE_CTX_get_error`):

@code
    static int ssl_verify(int ok, X509_STORE_CTX *store)
    {
      if (!ok)
      {
        char buf[1024];
        int err = X509_STORE_CTX_get_error(store);
        X509 *cert = X509_STORE_CTX_get_current_cert(store);
        switch (err)
        {
          case X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID:
          case X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED:
          case X509_V_ERR_DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT:
          case X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN:
          case X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_CRL:
          case X509_V_ERR_CRL_NOT_YET_VALID:
          case X509_V_ERR_CRL_HAS_EXPIRED:
            X509_STORE_CTX_set_error(store, X509_V_OK);
            ok = 1;
            break;
          default:
            fprintf(stderr, "SSL verify error %d or warning with certificate at depth %d: %s\n", err, X509_STORE_CTX_get_error_depth(store), X509_verify_cert_error_string(err));
            X509_NAME_oneline(X509_get_issuer_name(cert), buf, sizeof(buf)-1);
            fprintf(stderr, "  certificate issuer:  %s\n", buf);
            X509_NAME_oneline(X509_get_subject_name(cert), buf, sizeof(buf)-1);
            fprintf(stderr, "  certificate subject: %s\n", buf);
        }
      }
      return ok;
    }
    ...
    soap_wsse_verify_auto(soap, SOAP_SMD_NONE | SOAP_WSSE_IGNORE_EXTRA_REFS, NULL, 0);
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // file with CA certs of peers
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs directory
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)
    soap->fsslverify = ssl_verify;
@endcode

To verify the HMAC signature of an inbound message, the HMAC key must be
supplied:

@code
    static char hmac_key[16] = // the same secret key that was used to sign
    { 0xff, 0xee, 0xdd, 0xcc, 0xbb, 0xaa, 0x99, 0x88,
      0x77, 0x66, 0x55, 0x44, 0x33, 0x22, 0x11, 0x00 };
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    soap_wsse_verify_auto(soap, SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA1, hmac_key, sizeof(hmac_key));
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // file with CA certs of peers
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs directory
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)

    // server:
    if (soap_serve(soap))
      ... // an error occurred

    // client:
    if (soap_call_ns__myMethod(soap, ...))
      ... // an error occurred
@endcode

To summarize the signature verification process:

-# Register the wsse plugin.
-# For HMAC, obtain the HMAC secret key
-# Use `soap_wsse_verify_auto` to verify inbound messages.
-# Set the cafile (or capath) to verify certificates of the peers and crlfile
   (optional)
-# After receiving a message, the DOM in soap->dom can be traversed for further    analysis.
-# Always check the function return values for errors. You don't want to accept
   a request or response message with an invalid Security header.
-# Use `soap_wsse_verify_done` to terminate verification, e.g. to consume
   plain messages more efficiently.

@section wsse_9 Encryption

The material in this section relates to the WS-Security specification section 9.

The wsse plugin must be registered:

@code
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
@endcode

To send messages with inclusive canonicalization, in addition to the
`SOAP_XML_CANONICAL` flag also use: 

@code
    soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "*");
@endcode

However, exclusive canonicalization is recommended over inclusive
canonicalization, or no canonicalization at all.  WS Basic Security profile 1.0
requires exclusive canonicalization.

Flags to consider:

- `SOAP_XML_CANONICAL` recommended to enable exc-c14n (exclusive canonicalization).
- `SOAP_XML_INDENT` optional, to emit more readable XML (see warning).
- `SOAP_IO_CHUNK` efficient HTTP-chunked streaming messages.
- `SOAP_ENC_GZIP` for HTTP compression (also enables HTTP chunking).

@warning
Interoperability with WCF WS-Security is not guaranteed when `SOAP_XML_INDENT`
is enabled.  Avoid using `SOAP_XML_INDENT` for interoperability.  The
implementation of C14N in WCF with respect to the normalization of white space
between XML tags differs from the protocol standards.

@subsection wsse_9_1 Encrypting Messages

Encryption should be used in combination with signing. A signature ensures
message integrity while encryption ensures confidentially. Encrypted messages
can be tampered with unless integrity is ensured. Therefore, the reader should
be familiar with the material in Section @ref wsse_8 should to sign and verify
message content.

Messages are encrypted using either public key cryptography or by using a
symmetric secret key. A symmetric secret key should only be shared between the
sender and receiver (or any trusted communicating peer).

Encryption with public key cryptography uses an "envelope" process, where the
public key of the recipient is used to encrypt a temporary (ephemeral) secret
key that is sent together with the secret key-encrypted message to the
recipient. The recipient decrypts the ephemeral key and uses it to decrypt the
message. The public key is usually part of a X509 certificate. The public key
(containing the subject information) is added to the Security header and used
for encryption of the SOAP Body as follows:

@code
    X509 *cert = ...; //
    if (soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC, "Cert", cert, NULL, NULL, NULL))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
@endcode

`SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC` specifies envelope encoding with triple DES CBC and
PKCS1 RSA-1_5. Use `(SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_AES256_CBC | SOAP_MEC_OAEP)` for AES256
CBC with OAEP padding (OAEP is recommended over RSA-1_5 or use GCM).

The envelope encryption options are:

- `SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC`                    RSA-1_5 envelope encryption with triple DES CBC
- `SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_AES256_CBC`                 RSA-1_5 envelope encryption with AES256 CBC
- `SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_AES256_GCM`                 envelope authenticated encryption with AES256 GCM
- `SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_AES256_CBC | SOAP_MEC_OAEP` OAEP envelope encryption with AES256 CBC

where, in the above, AES256 can also be replaced with AES128 or AES192.

The "Cert" parameter is a unique URI to reference the key from the encrypted
SOAP Body. The above enables the encryption engine for the next message to be
sent, either at the client or server side. The server should use this withing a
server operation (before returning) to enable the service operation response to
be encrypted.

To include a subject key ID in the Security header instead of the entire public
key, specify the subject key ID parameter:

@code
    X509 *cert = ...; //
    if (soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC, "Cert", cert, "Subject Key ID", NULL, NULL))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
@endcode

The difference with the previous example where no subject key ID was specified
is that the Security header only contains the subject key ID and no longer the
public key in base64 format.

To exclude the encrypted key certificate from the message and include a
X509Data element with IssuerName and SerialNumber:

@code
    X509 *cert = ...;
    if (soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC, "Cert", cert, NULL, "CN=Root Agency", "-79441640260855276448009124614332182350"))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
@endcode

The issuer name and serial number (must be in decimal for
`soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey`) of a certificate can be obtained as follows:

@code
    X509 *cert = ...;
    BIGNUM *bn = BN_new();
    char issuer[256], *serial;
    X509_NAME_oneline(X509_get_issuer_name(cert), issuer, sizeof(issuer)-1);
    ASN1_INTEGER_to_BN(X509_get_serialNumber(cert), bn);
    serial = BN_bn2dec(bn);
    OPENSSL_free(bn);
    ...
    if (soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC, "Cert", cert, NULL, issuer+1, serial))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
    ...
    OPENSSL_free(serial);
@endcode

Note that in the above code the leading slash in "/CN=Root Agency" is excluded
from the issuer name.

When excluding the encrypted key certificate from the message, the token
handler callback must be provided on the receiving end to obtain the
certificate that corresponds to the issuer name and serial number. 

To encrypt specific elements of the SOAP Body rather than the entire SOAP Body,
use `soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey_encrypt_only` to specify elements to encrypt in
combination with `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` to specify these elements again as
follows:

@code
    X509 *cert = ...;
    // the SOAP Body contains one <ns:myContract> and one <ns:myPIN> (not nested)
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "ns:myContract ns:myPIN");
    if (soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey_encrypt_only(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC, "Cert", cert, NULL, NULL, NULL, "ns:myContract ns:myPIN"))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
@endcode

To encrypt the SOAP Body and SOAP Header element(s), such as ds:Signature, use
"SOAP-ENV:Body" with `soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey_encrypt_only` to specify these
elements:

@code
    X509 *cert = ...;
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "ds:Signature");
    if (soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey_encrypt_only(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC, "Cert", cert, NULL, NULL, NULL, "ds:Signature SOAP-ENV:Body"))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
@endcode

@note
The `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` MUST be used to specify all element tag names to
encrypt. Additional elements MAY be specified in `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` (for
example elements to digitally sign). You do not have to use this function to
set the wsu:Id of the SOAP Body which always has a wsu:Id with "Body".

@note
The elements identified by the tag names in `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` to
encrypt MUST occur NO MORE THAN ONCE in the XML message.

For symmetric encryption with a shared secret key, generate a 160-bit triple
DES key and make sure both the sender and reciever can use the key without it
being shared by any other party (key exchange problem). Then use the
`soap_wsse_encrypt_body` function to encrypt the SOAP Body as follows:

@code
    char des_key[20] = ...; // 20-byte (160-bit) DES shared secret key
    if (soap_wsse_encrypt_body(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENC_DES_CBC, des_key, sizeof(des_key)))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
@endcode

The symmetric encryption options are:

- `SOAP_MEC_ENC_DES_CBC`             symmetric encryption with triple DES CBC
- `SOAP_MEC_ENC_AES256_CBC`          symmetric encryption with AES256 CBC
- `SOAP_MEC_ENC_AES256_GCM`          symmetric authenticated encryption with AES256 GCM

where, in the above, AES256 can also be replaced with AES128 or AES192.

For example, symmetric encryption with AES256:

@code
    char aes256_key[32] = ...; // 32-byte (256-bit) AES256 shared secret key
    if (soap_wsse_encrypt_body(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENC_AES256_CBC, aes256_key, sizeof(aes256_key)))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
@endcode

To symmetrically encrypt specific elements of the SOAP Body rather than the
entire SOAP Body, use `soap_wsse_encrypt_only` to specify the elements to
encrypt in combination with `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` to specify these elements
again as follows:

@code
    char des_key[20] = ...; // 20-byte (160-bit) secret key
    // the SOAP Body contains one <ns:myContract> and one <ns:myPIN> (not nested)
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "ns:myContract ns:myPIN");
    if (soap_wsse_encrypt_only(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENC_DES_CBC, des_key, sizeof(des_key), "ns:myContract ns:myPIN"))
      soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
@endcode

@note
The `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` MUST be used to specify all element tag names to
encrypt. Additional elements MAY be specified in `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` (for
example elements to digitally sign).

@note
The elements identified by the tag names in `soap_wsse_set_wsu_id` to
encrypt MUST occur EXACTLY ONCE in the SOAP Body.

@subsection wsse_9_2 Decrypting Message Parts

The wsse engine automatically decrypts message parts, but requires a private
key or secret shared key to do so. A default key can be given to enable
decryption, but it will fail if a non-compatible key was used for encryption.
In that case a token handler callback should be defined by the user to select a
proper decryption key based on the available subject key name or identifier
embedded in the encrypted message.

An example of a token handler callback:

@code
    soap_register_plugin_arg(soap, soap_wsse);
    soap_wsse_set_security_token_handler(soap, security_token_handler);

    const void *security_token_handler(struct soap *soap, int *alg, const char *keyname, const unsigned char *keyid, int keyidlen, int *keylen)
    {
      // Get the user name from UsernameToken in message
      const char *uid = soap_wsse_get_Username(soap);
      switch (*alg)
      {
        case SOAP_SMD_VRFY_DSA_SHA1:
        case SOAP_SMD_VRFY_DSA_SHA256:
        case SOAP_SMD_VRFY_RSA_SHA1:

          {
            // Lookup uid to retrieve the X509 certificate to verify the signature
            const X509 *cert = ...; 
            return (const void*)cert;
          }
          break;
        case SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA1:
        case SOAP_SMD_HMAC_SHA224:

            *keylen = ...;
            return key;
          }

            *keylen = ... // length of the shared secret key
            return ...;
          }
          break;
      }
      return NULL; // fail
    }
@endcode

The last two case-arms are used to return a key associated with the keyname
paramater, which is a string that contains the subject key id from the public
key information in an encrypted message or the subject key ID string that was
set with `soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey` at the sender side.

@warning
The security token handler callback function parameters have changed in 2.8.34
and greater with the addition of KeyIdentifier information `keyid` and
`keyidlen`.

To set the default private key for envelope decryption, use:

@code
    EVP_PKEY *rsa_private_key = ...;
    soap_wsse_decrypt_auto(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_DEC_DES_CBC, rsa_private_key, 0);
@endcode

The envelope decryption options are:

- `SOAP_MEC_ENV_DEC_DES_CBC`                    RSA-1_5 envelope decryption with triple DES CBC
- `SOAP_MEC_ENV_DEC_AES256_CBC`                 RSA-1_5 envelope decryption with AES256 CBC
- `SOAP_MEC_ENV_DEC_AES256_GCM`                 envelope authenticated decryption with AES256 GCM
- `SOAP_MEC_ENV_DEC_AES256_CBC | SOAP_MEC_OAEP` OAEP envelope decryption with AES256 CBC

where, in the above, AES256 can be replaced with AES128 or AES192.

To set the default shared secret key for symmetric decryption, use:

@code
    char des_key[20] = ...; // 20-byte (160-bit) triple DES key
    soap_wsse_decrypt_auto(soap, SOAP_MEC_DEC_DES_CBC, des_key, sizeof(des_key));
@endcode

The symmetric decryption options are:

- `SOAP_MEC_DEC_DES_CBC`             symmetric decryption with triple DES CBC
- `SOAP_MEC_DEC_AES256_CBC`          symmetric decryption with AES256 CBC
- `SOAP_MEC_DEC_AES256_GCM`          symmetric authenticated decryption with AES256 GCM

where, in the above, AES256 can be replaced with AES128 or AES192.

For example, symmetric decryption with AES256:

@code
    char aes256_key[32] = ...; // 32-byte (256-bit) AES256 key
    soap_wsse_decrypt_auto(soap, SOAP_MEC_DEC_AES256_CBC, aes256_key, sizeof(aes256_key));
@endcode

If a default key is not set, the token handler callback should be used as
discussed above in this section. Do NOT set a default key if a token handler is
used to handle multiple different keys. The default key mechanism is simpler to
use when only one decryption key is used to decrypt all encrypted messages.

To remove the default key, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_decrypt_auto(soap, SOAP_MEC_NONE, NULL, 0);
@endcode

@subsection wsse_9_3 Example Client and Server

The code for a client is shown below that uses signatures and encryption:

@code
    FILE *fd;
    EVP_PKEY *rsa_private_key;
    X509 *cert;
    // create new context with recommended C14N enabled
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    // register the plugin(s)
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    // enable peer certificate verification
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // file with CA certs of peers
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs directory
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)
    soap->fsslverify = ssl_verify; // optional, a callback to verify peer certificates
    // get the private key for signing and decryption
    fd = fopen("privkey.pem", "r");
    rsa_private_key = PEM_read_PrivateKey(fd, NULL, NULL, "password");
    fclose(fd);
    // get the certificate to include in the security header
    fd = fopen("cert.pem", "r");
    X509 *cert = PEM_read_X509(fd, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    fclose(fd);
    // enable decryption with the private key
    soap_wsse_decrypt_auto(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_DEC_DES_CBC, rsa_private_key, 0);
    // enable signature verification
    soap_wsse_verify_auto(soap, SOAP_SMD_NONE, NULL, 0);
    // add the certificate X509 token and token reference, sign the Body using the private key
    if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
     || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token")
     || soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0))
      ... // an error occurred
    // encrypt the Body and the signature using the public key in cert (the cert of the peer)
    soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "ds:Signature");
    if (soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey_encrypt_only(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC, "Cert", cert, NULL, NULL, NULL, "ds:Signature SOAP-ENV:Body"))
      ... // an error occurred
    if (soap_call_ns__myMethod(soap, ...))
      ... // a transmission error occurred
    ...
    EVP_PKEY_free(rsa_private_key);
    X509_free(cert);
@endcode

When using HTTPS, the `soap->cafile`, `soap->capath` are already set with
`soap_ssl_client_context()`. The explicit assignments shown above are not
needed.

See @ref wsse_8_4 on how to implement the optional `ssl_verify` callback to
verify peer certificates.

You may want to register a token handler callback if the peer does not include
its X509 certificate in the security header. The token handler callback should
retrieve the certificate, e.g. given its id and serial number.

The server-side service is implemented as follows:

@code
    EVP_PKEY *rsa_private_key; // OK to declare global
    X509 *cert;                // OK to declare global
    ..
    FILE *fd;
    // create new context with recommended C14N enabled
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    // register the plugin(s)
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    // enable peer certificate verification
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // file with CA certs of peers
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs directory
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)
    soap->fsslverify = ssl_verify; // optional, a callback to verify peer certificates
    // get the private key for signing and decryption
    fd = fopen("privkey.pem", "r");
    rsa_private_key = PEM_read_PrivateKey(fd, NULL, NULL, "password");
    fclose(fd);
    // get the certificate to include in the security header
    fd = fopen("cert.pem", "r");
    X509 *cert = PEM_read_X509(fd, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    fclose(fd);
    ...
    if (!soap_valid_socket(soap_bind(soap, NULL, port, 100)))
      ... // an error occurred
    while (soap_valid_socket(soap_accept(soap)))
    {
      // enable signature verification
      soap_wsse_verify_auto(soap, SOAP_SMD_NONE, NULL, 0);
      // enable decryption with the private key
      soap_wsse_decrypt_auto(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_DEC_DES_CBC, rsa_private_key, 0);
      // serve one request
      if (soap_serve(soap))
      {
        soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap);
        soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
      }
    }
    ...
    EVP_PKEY_free(rsa_private_key);
    X509_free(cert);
@endcode

where an example service operation could be:

@code
    int ns__myMethod(struct soap *soap, ...)
    {
      ...
      // remove old security headers
      soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap);
      // encrypt the Body and the signature using the public key in cert (the cert of the peer)
      soap_wsse_set_wsu_id(soap, "ds:Signature");
      // add the certificate X509 token and token reference, sign the Body using the private key
      // encrypt the Body and the signature using the public key in cert (the cert of the peer)
      if (soap_wsse_add_BinarySecurityTokenX509(soap, "X509Token", cert)
       || soap_wsse_add_KeyInfo_SecurityTokenReferenceX509(soap, "#X509Token")
       || soap_wsse_sign_body(soap, SOAP_SMD_SIGN_RSA_SHA256, rsa_private_key, 0)
       || soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey_encrypt_only(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_ENC_DES_CBC, "Cert", cert, NULL, NULL, NULL, "ds:Signature SOAP-ENV:Body"))
      {
        soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap); // remove incomplete security headers
        return soap->error;
      }
      return SOAP_OK;
    }
@endcode

The service operation signs the Body using its private key and encrypts the
response Body and signature using a public key from the peer's certificate.

To implement a server that supports HTTP keep-alive, a `soap->fserveloop`
callback function should be assigned. This callback is executed in the
`soap_serve()` loop to call `soap_wsse_verify_auto()` and
`soap_wsse_decrypt_auto()` to ensure that the continuous inbound message stream
can be verified and decrypted:

@code
    struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL | SOAP_IO_KEEPALIVE);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    ...
    soap->fserveloop = set_verify_decrypt_auto;
    ...
    while (soap_valid_socket(soap_accept(soap)))
    {
      set_verify_decrypt_auto(soap);
      // serve multiple requests (when keep alive)
      if (soap_serve(soap))
      {
        soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap);
        soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
      }
    }

    int set_verify_decrypt_auto(struct soap *soap)
    {
      // enable signature verification
      soap_wsse_verify_auto(soap, SOAP_SMD_NONE, NULL, 0);
      // enable decryption with the private key
      soap_wsse_decrypt_auto(soap, SOAP_MEC_ENV_DEC_DES_CBC, rsa_private_key, 0);
      return SOAP_OK;
    }
@endcode

@section wsse_10 Security Timestamps

The material in this section relates to the WS-Security specification section
10.

To add a timestamp with the creation time to the Security header, use:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_Timestamp(soap, NULL, 0); // 0 means no expiration
@endcode

The lifetime of a message (in seconds) is passed as the third argument, which
will be displayed as the timestamp expiration time:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_Timestamp(soap, NULL, 10); // 10 seconds lifetime
@endcode

Timestamps, like other header elements, are not automatically secured with a
digital signature. To secure a timestamp, we add an identifier (wsu:Id) to each
element we want the WS-Security plugin to sign thereby making it impossible for
someone to tamper with that part of the message. To do this for the timestamp,
we simply pass a unique identification string as the second argument:

@code
    soap_wsse_add_Timestamp(soap, "Time", 10); // timestamp will be signed
@endcode

After receiving a message, the receiver can verify the presence and validity of
the timestamp and whether it was signed with:

@code
    if (!soap_wsse_verify_Timestamp(soap))
    {
      soap_wsse_delete_Security(soap);
      ... // error, no timestamp or timestamp has expired
    }
    else if (soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, "http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd", "Timestamp") > 0)
      ... // timestamp was signed
@endcode

@section wsse_11 WS-Security and HTTPS

HTTPS is used at the client side with the usual "https:" URL addressing, shown
here with the registration of the wsse plugin and setting up locks for
thread-safe use of SSL for HTTPS:

@code
    #include "wsseapi.h"
    #include "threads.h"
    struct soap *soap;
    if (CRYPTO_thread_setup())
      ... // error
    soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    if (soap_ssl_client_context(&soap,
      SOAP_SSL_DEFAULT, // requires server authentication
      NULL,             // keyfile for client authentication to server
      NULL,             // the keyfile password
      "cacerts.pem",    // cafile CA certificates to authenticate the server
      NULL,             // capath CA directory path to certificates
      NULL
    ))
      ... // error
    soap->cafile = "cacerts.pem";  // same as above (or overrides the above)
    soap->capath = "dir/to/certs"; // and/or point to CA certs
    soap->crlfile = "revoked.pem"; // use CRL (optional)
    ... // set up WS-Security for signatures/encryption etc
    if (soap_call_ns__myMethod(soap, "https://...", ...))
      ... // error
    ... // process response results
    soap_destroy(soap);
    soap_end(soap);
    soap_free(soap);
    CRYPTO_thread_cleanup();
@endcode

The CRYPTO threads should be set up before any threads are created.

The `soap_ssl_client_context` only needs to be set up once. Use the following
flags:

- `SOAP_SSL_DEFAULT` requires server authentication, CA certs should be used
- `SOAP_SSL_NO_AUTHENTICATION` disables server authentication
- `SOAP_SSL_SKIP_HOST_CHECK` disables server authentication host check
- `SOAP_SSL_ALLOW_EXPIRED_CERTIFICATE` to accept self-signed certificates, expired certificates, and certificates without CRL.

The server uses the following:

@code
    #include "wsseapi.h"
    #include "threads.h"
    SOAP_SOCKET m, s;
    int port = 443;
    struct soap *soap;
    if (CRYPTO_thread_setup())
      ... // error
    soap = soap_new1(SOAP_XML_CANONICAL);
    soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsse);
    if (soap_ssl_server_context(&soap,
      SOAP_SSL_DEFAULT, // requires server to authenticate, but not the client
      server.pem,       // keyfile for authentication to client
      "password",       // the keyfile password
      NULL,             // CA certificates to authenticate the client
      NULL,             // CA directory path to certificates
      NULL,             // use RSA 2048 bits (or give file name with DH param)
      NULL,
      NULL
    ))
      ... // error
    if (!soap_valid_socket(m = soap_bind(soap, NULL, port, 100))
      ... // error
    for (;;)
    {
      if (!soap_valid_socket(s = soap_accept(soap)))
        ... // error
      else
      {
        struct soap *tsoap = soap_copy(soap);
        while (THREAD_CREATE(&tid, (void*(*)(void*))&process_request, (void*)tsoap))
          sleep(1);
      }
    }
    soap_destroy(soap);
    soap_end(soap);
    soap_free(soap);
    CRYPTO_thread_cleanup();
@endcode

where we define a `process_request()` function that is executed by the thread
to process the request (on a copy of the soap context struct):

@code
    void *process_request(struct soap *soap)
    {
      ... // set up WS-Security for signatures/encryption etc
      if (soap_ssl_accept(soap)
       || soap_serve(soap))
        ... // error
      soap_destroy(soap);
      soap_end(soap);
      soap_free(soap);
  }
@endcode

The `soap_ssl_server_context` only needs to be set up once. Use the following
flags:

- `SOAP_SSL_DEFAULT` requires server authentication, but no client authentication
- `SOAP_SSL_REQUIRE_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION` requires client authentication

We also should implement the mutex setup and cleanup operations as follows:

@code
    struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value
    {
      MUTEX_TYPE mutex;
    };

    static MUTEX_TYPE *mutex_buf;

    static struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value *dyn_create_function(const char *file, int line)
    {
      struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value *value;
      value = (struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value*)malloc(sizeof(struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value));
      if (value)
        MUTEX_SETUP(value->mutex);
      return value;
    }

    static void dyn_lock_function(int mode, struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value *l, const char *file, int line)
    {
      if (mode & CRYPTO_LOCK)
        MUTEX_LOCK(l->mutex);
      else
        MUTEX_UNLOCK(l->mutex);
    }

    static void dyn_destroy_function(struct CRYPTO_dynlock_value *l, const char *file, int line)
    {
      MUTEX_CLEANUP(l->mutex);
      free(l);
    }

    void locking_function(int mode, int n, const char *file, int line)
    {
      if (mode & CRYPTO_LOCK)
        MUTEX_LOCK(mutex_buf[n]);
      else
        MUTEX_UNLOCK(mutex_buf[n]);
    }

    unsigned long id_function()
    {
      return (unsigned long)THREAD_ID;
    }

    int CRYPTO_thread_setup()
    {
      int i;
      mutex_buf = (MUTEX_TYPE*)malloc(CRYPTO_num_locks() * sizeof(pthread_mutex_t));
      if (!mutex_buf)
        return SOAP_EOM;
      for (i = 0; i < CRYPTO_num_locks(); i++)
        MUTEX_SETUP(mutex_buf[i]);
      CRYPTO_set_id_callback(id_function);
      CRYPTO_set_locking_callback(locking_function);
      CRYPTO_set_dynlock_create_callback(dyn_create_function);
      CRYPTO_set_dynlock_lock_callback(dyn_lock_function);
      CRYPTO_set_dynlock_destroy_callback(dyn_destroy_function);
      return SOAP_OK;
    }

    void CRYPTO_thread_cleanup()
    {
      int i;
      if (!mutex_buf)
        return;
      CRYPTO_set_id_callback(NULL);
      CRYPTO_set_locking_callback(NULL);
      CRYPTO_set_dynlock_create_callback(NULL);
      CRYPTO_set_dynlock_lock_callback(NULL);
      CRYPTO_set_dynlock_destroy_callback(NULL);
      for (i = 0; i < CRYPTO_num_locks(); i++)
        MUTEX_CLEANUP(mutex_buf[i]);
      free(mutex_buf);
      mutex_buf = NULL;
    }
@endcode

For additional details and examples, see the user guide and examples in the
gSOAP package directory gsoap/samples/ssl.

@section wsse_12 Miscellaneous

The Security header block was generated from the WS-Security schema with the
wsdl2h tool and WS/WS-typemap.dat:

    wsdl2h -cegxy -o wsse.h -t WS/WS-typemap.dat WS/wsse.xsd

The same process was used to generate the header file ds.h from the XML digital
signatures core schema, and the xenc.h encryption schema:

    wsdl2h -cuxy -o ds.h -t WS/WS-typemap.dat WS/ds.xsd
    wsdl2h -cuxy -o xenc.h -t WS/WS-typemap.dat WS/xenc.xsd

The import/wsse.h file has the following definition for the Security header
block:

@code
typedef struct _wsse__Security
{       struct _wsu__Timestamp*                 wsu__Timestamp;
        struct _wsse__UsernameToken*            UsernameToken;
        struct _wsse__BinarySecurityToken*      BinarySecurityToken;
        struct xenc__EncryptedKeyType*          xenc__EncryptedKey;
        struct _xenc__ReferenceList*            xenc__ReferenceList;
        struct ds__SignatureType*               ds__Signature;
        @char*                                  SOAP_ENV__actor;
        @char*                                  SOAP_ENV__role;
} _wsse__Security;
@endcode

The `_wsse__Security` header is modified by a WS/WS-typemap.dat mapping rule to
include additional details.

@section wsse_13 Some Limitations

- Encryption of simple content (CDATA content) directly with
  `soap_wsse_add_EncryptedKey_encrypt_only` is not supported.  You can encrypt
  elements with complex content (complexType and complexContent elements that
  have sub elements).  Decryption is not limited to elements with complex
  content.

- Encryption is performed after signing (likewise, signatures are verified
  after decryption).  Signing after encryption is not supported in the current
  plugin release.  It is generally known that it is safer to perform encryption
  after signing as the WSSE plugin performs, and not vice versa.

- Signing and encrypting XML containing QName content may lead to verification
  issues, because the W3C C14N exclusive canonicalization protocol has known
  limitations with QName content normalization.  In fact, not signing the
  prefix bindings as in C14N exclusive canonicalization is a security risk,
  because the prefix-URI binding can be modified when placed at an ancestor
  node that is not included in the signed XML content.  Use
  `soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "prefixlist")` to define all
  namespace prefixes (space-separated in the string) that should be considered
  inclusive. All prefixes used in QName content should be listed to mitigate
  the security risks outlined. The WSSE engine recognizes xsi:type,
  SOAP-ENC:arrayType, SOAP-ENC:itemType attribute QNames. Therefore, soapcpp2
  option `-t` is always safe to use, but a non-gSOAP receiver may still fail.

@section wsse_14 Defending Against Signature Wrapping Attacks

Signature wrapping attacks exploit a vulnerability in the XML DSig standard by
tricking the signature verifier to verify the signature of the signed content
but when this content is moved to a different place in the XML document, for
example where the content is ignored.  In this attack, a signed XML element
identified with an `id` attribute is moved in the document and replaced with an
unsigned replacement element with aribitrary content that the attacker created
and the receiver will use instead.  We refer to online articles and
publications on signature wrapping attacks for more details.

To defend against signature wrapping attacks, we recommend to sign the SOAP
Body instead of individual elements of the SOAP Body.  A receiver must verify
that the SOAP Body received is indeed signed and verify that other parts of the
message such as critical SOAP Headers are signed.  You can do this on the
receiving end by calling `soap_wsse_verify_body(soap)` and check that the
return value is nonzero.  This prevents signature wrapping attacks on the SOAP
Body.  If individual element(s) of the SOAP Body must be signed instead of the
body itself, then make sure to use call
`soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, "namespaceURI", "tag")` on the receiving end
and check that the return value is nonzero to verify that all elements matching
the namespaceURI and tag are signed.

If SOAP Headers are signed such as the timestamp and username token then make
sure to verify that the timestamp was indeed signed by calling
`soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, "http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd", "Timestamp")`
and check that the return value is nonzero. Likewise, to verify that the
usernameToken authentication credentials are signed, call
`soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, "http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd", "UsernameToken")`
and check that the return value is nonzero.

To prevent signature wrapping attacks on XML namespace prefixes used in QNames,
which are vulnerable when the prefix is bound to a namespace URI in an
ancester node to the signed content, use
`soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "prefixlist")`.  This makes the
namespace prefixes in the list (space-separated in the string) inclusive.
Use `soap_wsse_set_InclusiveNamespaces(soap, "+")` to automatically add all
prefixes defined in the namespace table (i.e. the .nsmap file) to the inclusive
namespace list (this requires gSOAP 2.8.64 or greater).

@section wsse_wsc WS-SecureConversation and WS-Trust

To use a WS-SecureConversation security context token (SCT) with WS-Security:

@code
    const char *identifier = "...";
    soap_wsse_add_SecurityContextToken(soap, "SCT", identifier);
@endcode

In this example a context has been established and the secret that is
identified by the 'identifier' string is known to both parties. This secret is
used to sign the message body. The "SCT" is a wsu:Id, which is used as a
reference to sign the token.

To compute PSHA1 with base64 input strings `client_secret_base64` and
`server_secret_base64` to output a base64-encoded `psha1[0..psha1len-1]` string
`psha1_base64`:

@code
    int psha1len = 32; // or greater
    int n, m;
    const char *client_secret = soap_base642s(soap, client_secret_base64, NULL, 0, &n);
    const char *server_secret = soap_base642s(soap, server_secret_base64, NULL, 0, &m);
    char psha1[psha1len];
    char *psha1_base64;
    if (soap_psha1(soap, client_secret, n, server_secret, m, psha1, psha1len))
      .. error // insufficient memory
    psha1_base64 = soap_s2base64(soap, (unsigned char*)psha1, NULL, psha1len);
@endcode

Similarly, PSHA256 can be computed by calling `soap_psha256()`.

@param soap context
@param URI namespace of element(s)
@param tag name of element(s)
@return number of matching elements that are signed or 0 if no matching elements found or if one or more non-signed matching elements were found (0 is returned to prevent signature wrapping attacks).

This function does not actually verify the signature of each element, but
checks whether the elements are signed and thus their integrity is preserved.
Signed element nesting rules are obeyed, so if the matching element is a
descendent of a signed element, it is signed as well.  Thus, the verification
process follows nesting rules.

Client should call this function after invocation. Services should call this
function inside a service operation. This function traverses the entire DOM, so
performance is determined by the size of a message.

To check the SOAP Body (either using SOAP 1.1 or 1.2), @ref soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, namespaces[0].ns, "Body"). To check whether the Timestamp was signed (assuming it is present and message expiration checked with @ref soap_wsse_verify_Timestamp), use @ref soap_wsse_verify_element(soap, "http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd", "Timestamp").
